# QUESTION: A comparison of modelling approaches for temporal network progression
## or "What are good methods for predicting small temporal network systems"

## Plan
Make a case for why to use SVDs to simplify the problem.\
Lay out a variety of small scale systems to predict.\
Introduce the challengers (What methods will we use?).\

## Notes 
We ARE modelling the whole system (Way more realistic, and SO SO SO much easier to implement)

What will be a good way of showing the results?
- Comparing training loss, and store an animation of the predictions vs actual on github

- not sure why L = R[1 0; 0 -1]

## Outline
### Intro
 - motivation for modeling temporal networks
 - how differential equations can be useful 
 - Limitations due to discrete networks 
 - Solution is to model the probability of edges occuring
 - Explaination for SVD and RDPG
 - Symbolic Regression?

### Methodology
